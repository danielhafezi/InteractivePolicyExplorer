## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision
The Interactive Policy Explorer (IPE) is a web-based application that democratizes economic policy understanding by allowing users to explore and visualize the potential impacts of various policies across different socio-economic groups. Using LLM-powered agent-based modeling, the tool simulates how policies related to AI adoption and green economic transitions affect political polarization, work identity, and socioeconomic outcomes.

### 1.2 Target Users
- Policy educators and students in economic/political sciences
- Public policy researchers and think tanks
- Journalists covering economic policy
- Concerned citizens seeking to understand policy implications
- Policymakers wanting to communicate policy impacts visually

### 1.3 Key Value Proposition
The IPE transforms complex economic policy discussions into intuitive visual simulations, making policy trade-offs transparent and accessible. By leveraging LLMs to simulate diverse human reactions, it provides a more nuanced view of policy impacts than traditional economic models, while remaining accessible to non-experts.
